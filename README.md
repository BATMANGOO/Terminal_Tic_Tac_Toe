# Terminal_Tic_Tac_Toe

Using OOP, I created a tic-tac-toe game in vanilla ruby. 
The game starts by asking for both (2 max) players names and which letter they would like to use. 
Then both players take turns filling in the board untill either the criteria of a winner or a tie game is met. 
The game will then ask if you'd like to play again and will start the game again from scratch if inputted 'y'.
